pyflac
David Collett (david.collett@dart.net.au)

This is a simple wrapper for some of libFLAC, namely the file decoder, file
encoder, and metadata interfaces. Most of the functions of these interfaces 
are working (I think).

The wrappers are mostly generated by swig, but I have also used my own python
shadow classes for some things. Using the wrappers should be intuitive for 
those already familiar with the C FLAC interfaces. Fairly complete sample code 
testing most of the functionality can be found in the examples directory.

To build you must have the following installed (debian pkg names provided)
swig (swig1.3)
python headers (python-dev)
flac headers (libflac-dev)

Some of the examples may require other packages also (like python-pyao). There
may be other packages I've forgotten.

There is a simple makefile for building, just type 'make'. There is currently
no install target in the makefile. To run the example programs you have to
have the PYTHONPATH set correctly eg:

$ PYTHONPATH=. examples/flac123.py test.flac

Have fun, please report any bugs or incomplete features.
