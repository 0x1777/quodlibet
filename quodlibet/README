Quod Libet - A Music Library/Player
========================================================================
Quod Libet is a music library management program. Rather than categorize
songs by genre, artist, and album, it keeps them all in one list that
you can filter however you want.

Quod Libet supports the Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, MP3, MOD/XM/IT, and MPC
file formats for playback. Tag editing and other features may vary
from format to format.

For a longer description and list of features, see
http://www.sacredchao.net/~piman/software/quodlibet.shtml#features.

For the FAQ, updated regularly, see
http://www.sacredchao.net/~piman/software/quodlibet.shtml#faq.

There is a mailing list for Quod Libet at quodlibet@lists.sacredchao.net.
To subscribe, email quodlibet-subscribe@lists.sacredchao.net. It is a
low traffic list so far (less than five mails a week). You can post without
subscribing, but please mention if you aren't subscribed and want direct
replies.

====[ Using QL

For help on using the program, run
 $ man -l ./quodlibet.1

Whenever you upgrade, it's a good idea to select "Reload library" from
the Music menu. This upgrades your library to take advantage of new
tag features found in the release. You should also read the NEWS
file for any important upgrade notes.
