Quod Libet - A Music Library/Player
========================================================================
Quod Libet is a music library management program. Rather than categorize
songs by genre, artist, and album, it keeps them all in one list that
you can filter however you want.

Quod Libet is designed for use with Ogg Vorbis audio files, but has
support for MP3 files following the ID3v1 and v2 "standards" as well.

Quod Libet is written entirely in Python and licensed under the GNU
GPL version 2.

====[ Neat Features
 - MP3, Ogg Vorbis, and FLAC audio format support.
 - Full support for the Vorbis comment format.
 - Album cover detection and display.
 - Regexp-based search support.

For a full description and list of features, see
http://www.sacredchao.net/~piman/software/quodlibet.shtml.

====[ Requirements

==[ Debian / Debian-based OSs

You must be running 'unstable' or a recent snapshot of it.

# apt-get install python-pymad python-pyvorbis python-id3lib python-glade2

==[ Other OSs

Find the above software and install it. PyGTK must be at least
version 2.4, or strange errors will happen.

====[ Using QL
For help on using the program, run
 $ man -l ./quodlibet.1

====[ Formal Query Grammar
This is a BNFish grammar that (at least when I checked it in) described
the grammar used for queries. It could be used for querying of a simple
key/value database.

Query           ::= QueryPart | QueryUnion | QueryInter | QueryNeg
QueryUnion      ::= '|(' QueryList ')'
QueryInter      ::= '&(' QueryList ')'
QueryNeg        ::= '!' Query
QueryList       ::= Query ',' QueryList | Query
QueryPart       ::= TagList '=' RegexpSet

TagList         ::= tag_name ',' TagList | tag_name

RegexpSet       ::= RegexpPart | RegexpUnion | RegexpInter | RegexpNeg
RegexpUnion     ::= '|(' RegexpList ')'
RegexpInter     ::= '&(' RegexpList ')'
RegexpNeg       ::= '!' RegexpSet
RegexpPart      ::= '/' regexp '/' [mods] | ':' regexp ':' [mods]
RegexpList      ::= RegexpPart ',' | regexp
