Quod Libet - A Music Library/Player
========================================================================
Quod Libet is a music library management program. Rather than categorize
songs by genre, artist, and album, it keeps them all in one list that
you can filter however you want.

Quod Libet is designed for use with Ogg Vorbis and FLAC audio files,
but has support for MP3 files following the ID3v1 and v2 "standards",
and tracked formats like MOD and XM.

For the FAQ, updated regularly, see

There is a mailing list for Quod Libet at quodlibet@lists.sacredchao.net.
To subscribe, email quodlibet-subscribe@lists.sacredchao.net. It has
been very low traffic so far.

====[ Using QL

For help on using the program, run
 $ man -l ./quodlibet.1

Whenever you upgrade, it's a good idea to select "Reload library" from
the Music menu. This upgrades your library to take advantage of new
tag features found in the release. You should also read the NEWS
file for any important upgrade notes.
