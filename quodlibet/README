Quod Libet - A Music Library/Player
========================================================================
Quod Libet is a music library management program. Rather than categorize
songs by genre, artist, and album, it keeps them all in one list that
you can filter however you want.

Quod Libet is designed for use with Ogg Vorbis audio files, but has
support for FLAC, MP3 files following the ID3v1 and v2 "standards", and
tracked formats like MOD and XM.

Quod Libet is written in Python and licensed under the GNU GPL version 2.

====[ Neat Features
 - Album cover detection and display.
 - Complex library filtering and searching.
 - Tag editing, including mass edits.
 - Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, and MOD/XM/IT support.

====[ Requirements

==[ Debian / Debian-based OSs

You must be running 'unstable' or a recent snapshot of it.

# apt-get install python-pymad python-pyvorbis python-id3lib python-glade2 \
                  python-pyao

There are several C extensions for Quod Libet you probably want. After
installing the software listed below, run
	# make extensions
prior to running 'make install' (or ./quodlibet.py), in order to compile
all extensions. If you only want some extensions, use the make targets
given below.

Tray icon (GNOME/KDE/XFce/etc. notification area):
	# apt-get install python2.3-dev python-gtk2-dev
	# make statusicon.so

Multimedia key support:
	# apt-get install python2.3-dev python-gtk2-dev
	# make mmkeys.so

MOD/XM/IT/etc. support:
	# apt-get install libmodplug-dev
	# make modplug.so

Alternately, if you have these modules installed system-wide already
(unlikely), you don't need to compile and install them.

==[ Other OSs

Find the above software and install it. PyGTK must be at least version 2.4,
or strange errors will happen. The Quod Libet website links to most of
the required software.

====[ Using QL
For help on using the program, run
 $ man -l ./quodlibet.1

Whenever you upgrade, it's a good idea to select "Reload library" from
the Music menu. This upgrades your library to take advantage of new
tag features found in the release.
