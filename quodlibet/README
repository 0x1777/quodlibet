Ex Falso / Quod Libet - A Music Library/Editor/Player
========================================================================
Quod Libet is a music library management program. Rather than categorize
songs by genre, artist, and album, it lets you search and display them
however you want. Ex Falso is a tag editor that has the same editing
features found in Quod Libet, but does not play audio files.

EF/QL support the Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, MP3, MOD/XM/IT, and MPC file formats
for playback. Tag editing and other features may vary from format to format.

For a longer description and list of features, see
http://www.sacredchao.net/~piman/software/quodlibet.shtml#features.

For the FAQ, updated regularly, see
http://www.sacredchao.net/~piman/software/quodlibet.shtml#faq.

There is a mailing list for EF/QL at quodlibet@lists.sacredchao.net.
To subscribe, email quodlibet-subscribe@lists.sacredchao.net. It is a
low traffic list so far (less than five mails a week). You can post without
subscribing, but please mention if you aren't subscribed and want direct
replies.

====[ Using EF/QL
To run the programs, use
 $ ./quodlibet.py
or
 $ ./exfalso.py

After installing, you can just run `quodlibet' or `exfalso'.

For help on using them, run
 $ man -l ./quodlibet.1

Whenever you upgrade, it's a good idea to select "Reload library" from
the Music menu. This upgrades your library to take advantage of new
tag features found in the release. You should also read the NEWS
file for any important upgrade notes.

====[ Requirements

==[ Source

EF/QL have a long, but not very complicated, dependency list. Many
of them probably come with your OS distribution.
 Python (>= 2.3):	http://www.python.org
 PyGTK (>= 2.6):	http://www.pygtk.org
 PyVorbis:		http://www.andrewchatham.com/pyogg/
 Pymad (MP3):		http://spacepants.org/src/pymad

To compile the status icon and multimedia key support, run
 $ make extensions

To install EF/QL system-wide, run
 # make install

==[ Debian / Debian-based OSs

Packages of EF/QL are available in Debian 'unstable'. They should not lag
behind releases by more than about 24 hours.

Because of this, packages also exist in Debian 'testing' although they
will be out of date for longer waiting for propogation from unstable.
They can also be found in Ubuntu's 'universe' repoistory.

# apt-get install quodlibet
