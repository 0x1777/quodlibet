.SH NAME
quodlibet \- music library and player
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBquodlibet\fR [ \fB\-\-print\-playing | \fB\-\-refresh\-library\fR | \fIcontrol\fR ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Quod Libet is a music library and player. Rather than keeping a single
playlist, it loads all your songs at once, and lets you filter and
play them based on information like title, artist, or album.
Quod Libet requires your music collection have appropriate tags,
made by (for example) \fBid3v2\fR and \fBvorbiscomment\fR. Most CD
ripping programs or music download services take care of this for you,
but older files may have missing or inaccurate tags.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP \-\-refresh\-library
Load your song library and configuration file. Deleted files will be
removed and changed files will be updated. This happens whenever
QL starts up, or when you select "Refresh library" from the Music
menu.
.IP \-\-print\-playing
Print out information about the currently playing song. This optionally
takes a format string as an argument. This format string looks like a
Python dictionary format string ("%(artist)\ \-\ %(title)")
but also supports conditional substrings using ?
("%(artist)?(album)\ \-\ %(album)?\ \-\ %(title)").
.IP \-\-next,\ \-\-previous,\ \-\-play\-pause,\ \-\-volume\-up,\ \-\-volume\-down
Control a currently-running instance of QL, as if the equivalent
buttons in the window had been clicked.
.SH USAGE
Use the "Add Music" item in the menu or click the "Add" icon on the
toolbar to add directories full of songs to your library. Once music
has been added to your library, enter the terms you wish to search in
the search box, and press enter or click on the search button. If you
want more control over the search, see the section entitled "Search
Syntax" below.
.PP
If you want to display album covers, put a file named "frontcover.jpg"
or "cover.jpg" in the same directory as the songs it goes with, and
make sure album cover displays are enabled in your preferences. GIF
and PNG images are also supported. QL will also look for any other
images with 'front', 'cover', or 'jacket' in their name.
.SH SEARCH SYNTAX
If you need more than simple searches, you can use QL's more advanced
search syntax, that lets you specify a specific tag to search. To use
this, enter a search in the form of
.RS
tag = /re/
.RE
Where \fItag\fR is the name of the tag you want to search (like 'artist'
or 'title'), and \fIre\fR is a regular expression you want
the tag to match. (If you don't know how to write regular expressions,
you can usually just use the word you want, if it doesn't contain
a '*', '\.', or '/'.)
.PP
You can combine searches using & and |:
.RS
tag = &(/re1/, /re2/)
.br
tag = |(/re1/, /re2/)
.RE
& requires that the tag match everything inside it, and | only
requires one match. You can also combine whole matches with & and |,
or check two tags at once. The following will find the same songs:
.RS
|(tag1 = /re/, tag2 = /re/)
.br
tag1, tag2 = /re/
.RE
.PP
Finally, you can select everything that doesn't match an expression
using !:
.RS
tag = !/re/
.RE
.PP
Because some tags are used commonly, abbreviations are provided. The
following two searches are the same:
.RS
artist = /Rasputina/
.br
a = /Rasputina/
.RE
Similar abbreviations exist for album ('b'), title ('t'), version
('v'), date ('d'), and track number ('n'). The '*' character matches 
any of album, title, or artist.
.PP
Normally searches are case-insensitive, so /BOA/ and /BoA/ are the
same. If you need case-sensitivity, put a 'c' on the end: /BOA/c and
/BoA/c.
.SH NUMERIC SEARCHES
In addition to matching strings with regular expressions, QL supports
searches with numeric comparisons. These searches begin with a '#'.
To view all songs longer than 2 minutes, or all tracks on any
album greater than 20 but less than 40:
.RS
#(length > 2:00)
.br
#(track > 20, track < 40)
.RE
You can also search for how long ago you last heard or modified a
song:
.RS
#(lastplayed > 8 days ago)
.br
#(mtime < today)
.RE
When searching using times, "greater than" means "older than" and
"less than" means "younger than". In the above, the first
selects all songs not played within the past 8 days, and the second
selects all songs changed within the last 24 hours.
.PP
Supported numeric fields are
.IR track ,
.IR disc ,
.IR length ,
.IR playcount ,
.IR mtime ,
and
.IR lastplayed .
Numeric searches can be combined with other searches. QL understands
units of minutes, hours, days, weeks (7 days), months (30 days), and years
(365 days), and times in "h:mm:ss" or "m:ss" format.
.SH EXAMPLES
Some more examples of advanced searching:
.RS
&(artist = /Sana/c, album = !/beatmania/)
.br
&(artist = /lindsay smith/, album = /fruitbat vat/)
.br
artist = |(/Pete Townshend/, /The Who/)
.br
&(artist = /Bach/, performer = /Glenn Gould/)
.br
album = &(/final fantasy/, /piano/, |(/VIII/, /IX/))
.br
title = &(|(/aozora/, /blue/), /knife/)
.br
filename = /.ogg$/
.br
&(genre = /classical/, #(lastplayed > 3 days))
.RE
.SH AUDIO BACKENDS
By default QL uses the Open Sound System (OSS) interface to play audio;
this interface is available on many operating systems and is (for QL's use)
full-featured. QL can also use the 'ao' audio backend, if you have
the pyao bindings installed. To do this, edit the 'backend' option in
~/.quodlibet/config to be 'ao:<driver>'; for example, 'ao:arts' for the aRts
ao backend, or 'ao:alsa09' for the ALSA 0.9 interface.
.SH FILES
.IP ~/.quodlibet/songs
A cached list of songs to load initially. The format is a pickled
Python list. Deleting this file will remove all songs from your
library.
.IP ~/.quodlibet/config
Quod Libet's configuration file. Don't manually edit this while QL is
running; it will not pick up the changes, and it will overwrite it
when you exit.
.IP ~/.quodlibet/current
A "key=value" file containing information about the currently playing song.
.IP ~/.quodlibet/control
A FIFO connected to the most-recently-started instance of the program.
\-\-next, \-\-previous, et cetera, use this to control the player.
.SH KNOWN NOT-BUGS
Newlines are not supported within tag values. Using them will break a lot
of tools, including QL.
.PP
Filenames not in UTF-8 aren't read properly, because we don't know what
encoding they are. Similarly, filenames are always written in UTF-8.
