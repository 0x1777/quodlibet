Translations
------------
Also, comments for translators where appropriate.

Use less Glade
--------------
The parts of the code that are messiest (like PropertiesWindow) are
that way at least partially from Glade. There's no good reason to be
using it now that the dialogs are reasonably mature, it's slow, and
it's big. These windows should be in Python, and new windows should
probably be written in python from the start.

Fix fs encoding bug
-------------------
Requires cleanups before attempting, so we have a good division between
displayed strings and byte strings (this is worst in Properties). See
util.fscoding for the way to get the encoding.

Clean up properties
-------------------
Don't enable widgets unless we're reasonably sure they can be used. This
means detecting unwriteable files both at the can_change level and at
the OS permissions level.

Remember UI element states
--------------------------
Show/hide state of the song list, the browser currently in use, and
whatever state that browser might need to save (current playlist,
current query). Again Glade will probably get in the way, and it will
be a fight with GTK's sizing.

GStreamer backend
-----------------
Experiment with a GStreamer backend. This is not very interesting from
a format perspective (yet), but it might let us avoid threading problems.

Support for more audio formats
------------------------------
Monkey's Audio is the most requested (i.e., everything else requested
has been implemented), but MA is not a freely licensed codec.

Format restructuring
--------------------
Rather than monolithic library/player files, import modules in a directory
"plugin"-style: mp3.py, oggvorbis.py, etc.

Covers from Muine
-----------------
Muine uses a pixmap serialization function to save to a BDB database.
This function is not available directly from PyGTK. If it was, this
would be easy.

Browser modes
-------------
In particular, an iTunes/RB-like browser, and a Muine-style album browser.

Album cover download
--------------------
Amazon has a ToS I can't agree to, but a Google image search for the
album name (or especially label ID) seems to be effective.

More unit tests
---------------
Really, they're crap now.

Rewrite parser
--------------
Support queries like the following:
 New format		Equivalent old format
 artist = "Foobar"	artist = /^Foobar$/c
 #(3 < track <= 10)	|(&(#(track > 3), #(track < 10)), #(track = 10))
 #(disc != 0)		!#(disc = 0)	

New keys
--------
Time added to library, number of times skipped, rating.

Others
------
RPM spec/package, Gentoo ebuild, whatever.

Not Interested
--------------
Streaming. It doesn't fit well into our library model, and it might never.

Transcoding, ripping, burning, better PMP management. Get a separate
program, and we'll integrate with it.
