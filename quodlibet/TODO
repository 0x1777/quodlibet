- More unit tests.
- Full FLAC support.
- Various skipping problems -- get smarter about Python threads.
- MikMod support.
- Import covers from Muine.
  - We need to deserialize the pixmap data, whatever it's doing, which
    doesn't seem to be exposed via PyGTK.
- Streaming & playlists.
  - New UI element(s) for selecting playlists or streams. Combobox next
    to search, Library/Playlist/Streams?
- Look into eventual GStreamer port/use (for playing).
  - This is probably going to end up not useful unless it solves the
    skipping issue.
- Portable device support
  - Sending files to them (via some script, ~/.ql/send or something...)
- A "better" ID3 library. But these are in short supply, and we'd just
  write incompatible tags anyway.
