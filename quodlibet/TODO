JZig) I can resize vertically with nothing, but not with only search box
(piman) oh, heh, the searchbox size is resizable.


(inigo) column.set_reorderable(True) only has a problem
(inigo) when user clicks over a header to move the column, the model sorting
+begins, so it's not very UI friendly
(piman) oh! I read that wrong, sorry. I saw "set_reorderable" and thought rows
+. Yeah, column reordering should be easy.
(inigo) because UI halts until sorting ends
(JZig) I would like column reordering
(JZig) so my custom columns arent always at the end
(piman) It might better to change the preferences dialog, to make reordering
+happen there. It's less convenient, but doesn't have the speed problems.
(inigo) maybe a small treeview without any data, only headers
(inigo) and then real treeview keep preferences one

Doable by whomever, whenever:
- Translations.
- RPM spec/package.
- Additional format support.
- Additional tag-editing modes/operations.
- Support for whatever tags are popular with kids these days.

Stuff that I probably have to do:
- More unit tests.
- Nail TreeView sizing down hard.
- Various skipping problems -- get smarter about Python threads.
- Look into eventual GStreamer port/use (for playing).
  - This is probably going to end up not useful unless it solves the
    skipping issue.

Things that would be nice if someone did, but I won't pursue them:
- Import covers from Muine.
  - We need to deserialize the pixmap data, whatever it's doing, which
    doesn't seem to be exposed via PyGTK.
- Streaming & playlists.
  - New UI element(s) for selecting playlists or streams. Combobox next
    to search, Library/Playlist/Streams?
- A "better" ID3 library. But these are in short supply, and we'd just
  write incompatible tags anyway.
