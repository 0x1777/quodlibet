- Handle weird UI flukes (seek past end of song, etc) better
- Stress-testing
- Artist URL detection
- Song information popup
- Context menu - remove song from library
- Handle case when song is loaded but then goes missing
- Wacky: Hook into Kakasi, romanize Japanese tags, allow searching on them
- Figure out why loading text doesn't appear on throbber
