An unintrusive clear button.
Remember hidden UI element states
Don't let editing modes try to write tags they actually can't.
Encoding bug

Doable by whomever, whenever:
- Translations.
- RPM spec/package.
- Additional format support.
- Additional tag-editing modes/operations.
- Support for whatever tags are popular with kids these days.

Stuff that I probably have to do:
- More unit tests.
- Less Glade means smaller size, easier changes, and more testability!
- Various skipping problems -- get smarter about Python threads.
- Look into eventual GStreamer port/use (for playing).
  - This is probably going to end up not useful unless it solves the
    skipping issue.

Things that would be nice if someone did, but I won't pursue them:
- Import covers from Muine.
  - We need to deserialize the pixmap data, whatever it's doing, which
    doesn't seem to be exposed via PyGTK.
- Playlists, album browser, iTunes browser...
  - New UI element(s) for selecting browser-type, or search, or &c...

Wontadd:
- Streaming.
- More featureful PMP management.
- Automatic album cover downloads.
- Transcoding, ripping, burning.
- Monkey's Audio (unless it gets freed), MPC (worse than Vorbis in all ways).
