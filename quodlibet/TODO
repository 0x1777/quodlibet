- More unit tests.
- Full FLAC support.
- Various skipping problems -- get smarter about Python threads.
- MikMod support.
- Import covers from Muine.
  - We need to serialized the pixmap data, whatever it's doing, which
    doesn't seem to be exposed via PyGTK.
- Streaming & playlists.
  - New UI element(s) for selecting playlists or streams. Combobox next
    to search, Library/Playlist/Streams?
- Look into eventual GStreamer port/use (for playing).
  - This is probably going to end up not useful.
