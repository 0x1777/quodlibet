Remember hidden UI element states
 - This will require fighting with GTK sizing.
Filename encoding bug
 - see util.fsencoding, will need a lot of testing

Don't let editing modes try to write tags they actually can't.
 - sanely, requires rewriting SongProps (and don't use glade,
   while we're at it).
(JZig) I want sorting to work in the editor
(JZig) and then I can move blocks of things as needed afterwards
(piman) What if it just added them sorted by track?
(JZig) that works fine

Doable by whomever, whenever:
- Translations.
- RPM spec/package.

Stuff that I probably have to do:
- More unit tests.
- Less Glade means smaller size, easier changes, and more testability!
- Various skipping problems -- get smarter about Python threads.
- Look into eventual GStreamer port/use (for playing).
  - This is probably going to end up not useful unless it solves the
    skipping issue.

Things that would be nice if someone did, but I may not pursue them:
- Import covers from Muine.
  - We need to deserialize the pixmap data, whatever it's doing, which
    doesn't seem to be exposed via PyGTK.
- Album browser, iTunes browser...

Wontadd:
- Streaming.
- More featureful PMP management - use a separate application.
- Automatic album cover downloads.
- Transcoding, ripping, burning.
- Monkey's Audio (unless it gets freed).
