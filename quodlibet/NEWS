0.6
 - Mass-set track numbers.
 - Fix a race condition on startup resulting in a crash. (I think.)
 - Tag by Pattern can replace or add new tags.
 - Rename by Tag properly keeps songs in the library.
 - Maskable mount points. This lets you add files from an NFS share or
   portable device and not have to readd them if you unmount and remount it.
 - Support for sending files to PMPs from the context menu has been
   added; currently devices that look like a hard drive and the iRiver
   iFP series are supported.
 - --next, --previous, --play-pause, --volume-up, --volume-down, --mute.
 - MOD/IT/XM/etc. support, using libmodplug and an included C extension.
   As usual for MODs, seeking doesn't work right.

0.5 - Everything's fine, CEPT YOU GOT NO LEGS!
 - The ao audio backend is back; see the "AUDIO BACKENDS" section in the
   manual page for instructions on using it. This should let ALSA users
   use software mixing.
 - ID3 APIC (embedded picture) support.
 - VorbisGain (http://sjeng.org/vorbisgain.html) support.
 - A context menu for common operations was added to the properties dialog.
 - Tag values can be set from filename patterns, or vice-versa.
 - Dates can be saved in MP3s now.
 - --print-playing option, with a format string.
 - More UI tweaks.
 - Translation template update.
 - Many bug fixes; please reload your library. You can now reload your
   library from the "Music" menu.

0.4 - The Power of Language
 - Many bug fixes, primarily due to unit testing.
 - Tweaks to cover detection to pick 'frontcover' over 'backcover'.
 - Tweaks to song display, including proper support for the 'author' tag.
 - Remember size between invokations.
 - A freedesktop.org-compatible system tray icon, using the Egg status
   icon code by Anders Carlsson and Sun.
 - Multimedia key support, provided they're mapped (e.g. by Acme), using
   the MmKeys object from Muine by Lee Willis and Jan Arne Petersen.
 - UI tweaks to the main window.
 - Button to link to a song's website, or a Google search.
 - Infrastructure is in place for i18n/l10n, but I'm totally new to
   this, so I could've done something horribly wrong.

0.3
 - Handle mono MP3s correctly.
 - Crash less, especially when editing tags.
 - Many smaller bug fixes.

0.2
 - Song properties dialog, featuring mass tag editing/addition/removal.
 - Build/installation scripts.
 - Interface tweaks for HIG compliance and accessibility.
 - Try to save the library when ^C is pressed.
 - ~/.quodlibet/current interface to currently-playing song.
 - Save current query and song on exit.
 - An icon.
 - FLAC support. Writing to FLAC tags could be *very* buggy, so if you
   value your tags, please back them up.

0.1
 - Initial release.
