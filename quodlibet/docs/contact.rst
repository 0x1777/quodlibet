Contact
=======

It's easy to find the email addresses of Quod Libet's authors and 
maintainers, but please don't email us directly unless asked to, or if it 
concerns us specifically. If you contact just us, it means no one else can 
help you, and we can be really bad about replying to email.


Reporting Bugs
--------------

The best way to report bugs is using the GitHub issue tracker.

 * `Add a new bug <https://github.com/quodlibet/quodlibet/issues/new>`_
 * `Show current bugs <https://github.com/quodlibet/quodlibet/issues>`_

For tips on how to report bugs see :ref:`the Contributing Guide <BugReports>`


Mailing List
------------

If you're not sure if the behavior is a bug, or if you have other 
questions, the best way to contact us is through the `quod-libet-devel 
Google group <http://groups.google.com/group/quod-libet-development>`_.


IRC
---

Quod Libet has an IRC channel on `OFTC <http://www.oftc.net/>`_ , 
*#quodlibet*. IRC is not a good place to report bugs; we'll just refer you 
to the mailing list if you try. It is a good place to ask for help with 
installation and configuration, or discuss development (assuming people 
there are paying attention).
