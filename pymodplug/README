ModPlug Player in Python
------------------------
This Python module lets you load and decode files supported by the ModPlug
library (which includes MODs, ITs, XMs, and so on). Its API has been chosen
to mostly match pyvorbis and pymad.

Currently it always outputs in 44100khz stereo, 16 bits per channel. Noise
reduction, oversampling, and the highest-quality resampling filter are
enabled.

libmodplug can be found at http://modplug-xmms.sourceforge.net.

Compiling:
----------
This module has only been tested on Python 2.3. It definitely won't
work on 2.1 or earlier.

$ ./setup.py build

Usage:
------
modplug uses Python docstrings as its primary form of documentation.
>>> import modplug; help(modplug)

See 'playmod.py' for an example of a simple player.
